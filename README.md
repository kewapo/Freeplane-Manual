New Freeplane English Manual 


## INSTRUCTIONS


* Install the Libertinus font type (included in this repository). The manual is written with this font.
* Import the template used for the manual it in your Libreoffice (it is included too).

* I use a master libreoffice file for the whole manual, `master.odt` and single files for each chapter located in the `Chapters` directory.
* To write a new chapter open the `Generic Chapter.odt` file and save it in the `Chapters directory. Then add it to the master file.
